Views
- easy to understand
-ejs, hbs, or some other template engine files

Controller
- contains logic
- for example logging in logic (for users.js or admins.js etc)
- handles responses (res)

Model
- models our data (mongoose schemas are here)
- has rules (such as functions which are exported to validate user input)
- models define the types of information that get used by your views and controllers.

A REST API is a stateless interface to your application. In the case of the
MERN or MEAN stack, the REST API is used to create a stateless interface to your
database, enabling a way for other applications to work with the data.

-----------

app_api
- models are db schemas
- controllers are functions (getting and setting data etc)
- routes are the handlers
